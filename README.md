## How to install Passy

There are two ways to install Passy: run the pre-compiled binary `.exe` file (Windows) or run it from source (Linux, MacOS). Currently, the pre-compiled binary is not available for MacOS and Linux (sorry üò¶, just give me a bit more time).

### Pre-compiled binary (Windows)
For most, the first option will sufice. To get the `.exe` file, go to the `Releases` tab on the side of this web page, and click on the latest release. Then, scroll down to the `Assests` section and click on the `Windows zip file` option. This will download a zip file containing the `passy.exe` file. Once you extract the folder, you will find the `passy.exe` file.

<b>‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT remove other files located in the folder with the `.exe` file, or move the `.exe` file out of the folder it was in.</b>

### Running from source (Linux, MacOS)

Please ensure you have Python installed on your machine before proceeding.

To run from source, click the green `Code` button on the top of the webpage and then click on the `Download Zip` button. This will download a zip file containing the source code. Once the zip file is downloaded, extract it and open a terminal inside the folder. From the terminal run (without the $):
```bash
$ python main.py
```
